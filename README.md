## Reproducible research on the paper 'Power of Deep Learning for Channel Estimation and Signal Detection in OFDM Systems'

original code is from [here](https://github.com/haoyye/OFDM_DNN)

the train and test dataset can be download at [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qi0k9SY4tXs7EazEARDc8ncvaIltMr59)

First, creat a folder named "H_dataset", then put 'OFDM_DNN.py', the train and test dataset in. Third, run 'OFDM_DNN.py'.

please enjoy.
